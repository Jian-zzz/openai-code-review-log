以下是对提供的Git diff记录的代码评审：

### OpenAiCodeReviewService.java
- **Line 37**: The code has changed from `Model.GLM_4_FLASH.getCode()` to `Model.GLM_4.getCode()`. This could be a typo or a deliberate change.
  - **If Typo**: Ensure that `GLM_4_FLASH` is the correct model and not a typo. If it was a typo, revert to `GLM_4_FLASH.getCode()`.
  - **If Deliberate**: Confirm the reason for the change. If the `GLM_4_FLASH` model has been deprecated or replaced with `GLM_4`, document this change in the commit message and update any relevant documentation.
  - **Review `ChatCompletionRequestDTO`**: Since the model has been changed in the service, ensure that the corresponding `ChatCompletionRequestDTO` class has the same change in the constructor or wherever the model is initialized.

### ChatCompletionRequestDTO.java
- **Line 14**: The `model` field has been updated from `GLM_4_FLASH.getCode()` to `GLM_4.getCode()`. This should be in sync with the `OpenAiCodeReviewService` changes.
  - **Review Initialization**: Ensure that any other parts of the code that initialize this DTO are also updated to use `GLM_4.getCode()`.

### ApiTest.java
- **Line 21**: There is a change from `Integer.parseInt("aa1234")` to `Integer.parseInt("aaaa1234")`. This seems to be an error because both strings contain non-numeric characters and will throw a `NumberFormatException`.
  - **Fix**: Remove the non-numeric characters from the string before parsing it to an integer.
  - **Example**: `System.out.println(Integer.parseInt("1234"));`
  - **Test**: Add a test to ensure that the `Integer.parseInt` method does not throw an exception when the correct string is passed.

### General Observations
- **Commit Message**: Ensure that the commit message clearly states what was changed and why, especially for the model change in both `OpenAiCodeReviewService` and `ChatCompletionRequestDTO`.
- **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect any changes in the API or model usage.
- **Testing**: Ensure that all related tests are updated to reflect the changes, and add new tests if necessary.
- **Code Style**: Check for any inconsistencies in coding style and address them accordingly.
